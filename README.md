## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Node, Firebase, and Webpacks that allows users to navigate through a sugary sweet world. 
This project was to demonstrate the ability to recreate a website with Angular and Firebase. This was a very front end heavy project. I recreated the majority of the Home page and Classes page with the ability to view Class Detail with Firebase API calls.



## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repository
2. Download and install Node.js and Node package manager and Angular(This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.) 
3. In command line, in the project main, use command $ npm install
4. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
5. You will need to have your own Firebase credentials, create a project, and clone the JSON 
6. Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
7. Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
8. Enjoy!
